Added flags: -msse -msse2 -static-libgcc

For the Windows platform, LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH were changed from the default
in luaconf.h as follows:

	`..\..\?.lua;..\..\?\init.lua` was added to LUA_PATH.
	This allows require(<any-luapower-module>) regardless of what the current directory is.
	This only solves the problem of finding luapower modules independent of current directory.
	To find your app modules too independent of current directory use `glue.lib`.

	LUA_CPATH was changed from '!\?.dll' to `!\clib\?.dll`.
	This allows luapower.lua to find C Lua modules separate from other dll files
	that are not C Lua modules.
