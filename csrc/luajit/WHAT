luajit 2.0.2 from http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git (MIT license)

The Windows build comes with a modified package.path as follows:

`..\..\?.lua;..\..\?\init.lua` was added to LUA_PATH in luaconf.h.
This allows require(<any-luapower-module>) regardless of what the current directory is.
This only solves the problem of finding luapower modules, but your app modules
are probably in a different directory. You could use lua-find-bin and lua-lib from
github.com/davidm for that. Add them to luapower to avoid the obvious chicken/egg problem.
